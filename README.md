## Basic troubleshooting

#### The app crashes during startup or game launch

Try the yuri version instead of the vanilla, since it contains patches to common issues.

#### I get the wide string error during game launch

Make sure that the game is listed in the compatibility list, some game modifications do not support Kirikiroid

#### The files directory is empty

Enable *All files access* permission in system settings

## Lazy todo

- [ ] Find the source of the clicking issue during dialogue skip

## Files

Original project files are located in `kiri2_src` and yuri project in `kiri2_yuri`. Unchanged `Kirikiroid2.smali` is in the repository root.
